/// This is the detailed one. More details
/// @param d_name This name of the Circuit
/// @param d_numImputs This the number of inputs in the Circuit
/// @param d_numOutputs This the number of outputs in the Circuit
/// @param d_maxLevel This possible maximum number of logical operations, also
/// is level of the Circuit*
/// @param d_numEdges This the number of transitions within the circuit, they
/// are called edges, as in graphs the transition between vertices*
/// @param d_reliability This parameter shows the probability that we will
/// receive a true signal at the output. Its range is between 0 and 1
/// @param d_size This parameter shows the number of logical elements in the
/// circuit. For example, the number of logic gates, transistors, or other basic
/// elements
/// @param d_area In the Circuit, it usually refers to the physical area
/// @param d_longestPath This parameter shows the longest path from the entrance
/// to the exit*
/// @param d_gates The number of different logical operations on the circuit,
/// for example and, or, XOR, and so on
/// @param d_sensitivityFactor This parameter gives information about possible
/// change in the output signal, when measuring the input signal*
/// @param d_reliabilityPercent The percentage of reliability in combination
/// circuits usually means the probability that the circuit will work correctly
/// under given input conditions for a certain period of time or number of
/// operations*
/// @param d_hashCode ???
/// @param d_numElementsOfEachType This map contains the name of the element and
/// how many times it occurs in the Circuit?
